Perfect.
I will now convert **everything you designed** into a **clean, professional, GitHub-ready Markdown blueprint**.

This is **NOT rewriting logic** — this is **structuring it like a real open-source / startup repository** so that:

* Developers understand scope
* Contributors know what to build
* Elders / samaj leaders can read vision
* Investors / NGOs can trust seriousness
